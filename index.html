    <h1>Classes and IDs</h1>
    <p id="intro">
        Classes and IDs are 'attribute selectors'. This means that you can attach style to HTML elements based on that element's attributes. This empowers you to apply different style to items of the same HTML type.
     </p>
     <p class="odd">
         Classes are an HTML attribute that specifies a name for a group of elements on the page. You can apply the calss name to as many elements as you like, even if they are of different HTML tag types. You can use the class name with a period in front as the selector.
    </p>
    <p class="even">
        ID names have the same rules as class names: start with a letter, can include numbers and dashes, no spaces. The way to create a selector for an ID is also similar to how you create a selector for a class, except you replace the period with a hash symbol ("#").
